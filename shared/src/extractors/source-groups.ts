 *   - "selected_plus_remote_worldwide"        → selected country sources +
 *                                                global remote-only boards.
 *   - "remote_worldwide_prioritize_selected"  → global remote-only boards +
 *                                                country sources kept as a
 *                                                secondary signal.
 *
 * The two remote-friendly modes auto-include the remote-only boards we wired
 * in via PR1 + PR2 so the user doesn't have to enable them manually.
