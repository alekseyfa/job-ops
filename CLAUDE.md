# Job-Ops – Agent Instructions

> These instructions apply to **every AI agent** (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, OpenCode, Cursor, Codex) working in this repository.

## Project Overview

Job-ops is a monorepo (orchestrator, shared, extractors, docs-site) for automated job search and application tracking. Node.js 22, Express backend, React frontend, SQLite (Drizzle ORM), Docker-based deployment.

**Primary user interface: Telegram bot.**

## Environment

- **No node/npm on host machine.** All commands run inside Docker.
- Docker image: `node:22-slim` for quick checks, `docker compose` for full stack.
- Intel corporate proxy: `http://proxy-dmz.intel.com:912`, CA certs at `gnai-ca-certs.pem`.

## Mandatory: Validate Before Reporting

**Never report work as done without validation.** Before telling the developer that changes are complete:

1. **Type check** — run inside Docker:
   ```bash
   MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1 docker run --rm -v "<repo-path>:/app" -w /app node:22-slim \
     sh -c "npx tsc --noEmit -p shared/tsconfig.json && npx tsc --noEmit -p orchestrator/tsconfig.json"
   ```
   Verify that **no new errors were introduced** (pre-existing errors in `linkedin-auto-apply` module are known and acceptable).

2. **Unit tests** — run inside Docker:
   ```bash
   MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1 docker run --rm -v "<repo-path>:/app" -w /app node:22-slim \
     sh -c "./orchestrator/node_modules/.bin/vitest run"
   ```
   Verify that **no previously passing tests now fail**.

3. **Docker build** (if Dockerfile or extractor structure changed):
   ```bash
   docker compose build --no-cache
   ```

4. **Report results honestly.** If something fails, say so — don't hide errors.

## Mandatory: Changelog Notifications

After implementing **user-facing features, significant improvements, or important fixes**, the agent MUST ask the developer:

> "Should I add this to the changelog so Telegram bot users are notified?"

If the developer says yes:

1. Open `orchestrator/src/server/services/telegram-bot/changelog.ts`
2. Add a new entry to the `CHANGELOG` array (newest first) with:
   - `version` — bump appropriately (patch for fixes, minor for features)
   - `date` — today's date in YYYY-MM-DD
   - `items` — array of changes, each with:
     - `title` — emoji + short name (e.g., "📡 ATS Board Scanner")
     - `description` — 1-2 sentences in **simple, non-technical language**. Any user should understand what changed and how it helps them.
     - `tip` (optional) — brief instruction on how to use the new feature
3. The Telegram bot automatically sends and **pins** the message to all users on next startup.

### Writing guidelines for changelog entries:
- Write for non-technical users
- Explain WHAT changed and WHY it's useful, not HOW it was implemented
- If the user needs to take action, include a `tip`
- Keep it brief — 1-2 sentences per item max
- Use English

## Key Architecture Notes

### Telegram Bot
- Grammy library, long-polling mode
- Handlers in `orchestrator/src/server/services/telegram-bot/handlers/`
- Callback routing: `j:` jobs, `p:` pipeline, `s:` stats, `x:` settings, `b:` boards, `a:` auto-apply, `m:` menu
- Auth via `/link <code>` with one-time codes from Settings UI
- The bot is the PRIMARY user interface — all new features should have Telegram integration

### Extractors
- Each extractor is a workspace package in `extractors/<name>/`
- Must export an `ExtractorManifest` from `manifest.ts` or `src/manifest.ts`
- Register source IDs in `shared/src/extractors/index.ts`
- **If adding a new extractor, also add it to the Dockerfile** (both build and production stages)

### Settings
- Defined in `shared/src/settings-registry.ts` (Zod schemas, parse/serialize)
- `SettingKey` type is derived from registry keys — new settings must be registered there

### LLM Providers
- 8 providers in `orchestrator/src/server/services/llm/providers/`
- Factory pattern via `createProviderStrategy`
- Anthropic provider uses GNAI endpoint with JWT auth

### PDF Generation
- Two renderers: `rxresume` (default) and `latex`
- ATS text normalization applied in `orchestrator/src/server/services/rxresume/tailoring.ts`

## Common Pitfalls

- **Docker path with spaces**: Use `MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1` prefix on Windows/Git Bash
- **New extractor not loading**: Check it's in Dockerfile AND registered in `shared/src/extractors/index.ts`
- **New setting not recognized**: Must be added to `shared/src/settings-registry.ts`
- **Telegram menu not updating**: Docker build cache — use `--no-cache`
- **Type errors in `Record<ExtractorSourceId, ...>`**: When adding source IDs, also update `demo-defaults.data.ts` and `extractor-health.ts`
